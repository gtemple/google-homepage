Hello, this is my first ever programming/coding project. So far, I feel pretty good about it but I know things are most likely only going to get worse.

So far for this project, I've had to open up my console, create a new folder from within the console, create a new repository via GitHub, clone it locally, and create a Read Me file which I am currently writing in.

Nice knowin' ya'
